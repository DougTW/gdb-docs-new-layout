Known Issues
============


-  Defining a breakpoint at a location before a kernel (i.e. inside the
   host code) causes the breakpoint to be also defined at the start of
   the kernel. This is analogous to defining a breakpoint at a comment
   line or an empty line and the breakpoint being defined for the next
   source line.
-  While a workload submitted to a subdevice of a GPU is being debugged,
   no other workload can be executed or debugged on the *same* subdevice.
-  If the current SIMD lane becomes inactive within a thread, the thread
   might silently switch its current SIMD lane to its first active SIMD
   lane.
-  The ``next`` and ``step`` commands may take several seconds to
   complete execution.
-  The debugger may stop responding if you disable displaced-stepping before
   the start of a GPU kernel.
