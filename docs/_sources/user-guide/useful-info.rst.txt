Useful debugging features
*************************

Here are four useful debugging features: live-attach, auto-attach,
pretty-printing, and prettify-frames. The first two are used to attach
the gdb-oneapi debugger to an application that is already running but is
not being debugged. The second two provide ways to simplify the display
of complex SYCL objects and templates.
